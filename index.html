            <p>A tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by a low-pressure center, 
            a closed low-level atmospheric circulation, strong winds, and a spiral arrangement of 
            thunderstorms that produce heavy rain. Depending on its location and strength, a tropical 
            cyclone is referred to by different names, including hurricane, typhoon, tropical storm, 
            cyclonic storm, tropical depression, and simply cyclone. A hurricane is a tropical cyclone 
            that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean, and a typhoon occurs in 
            the northwestern Pacific Ocean; while in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean, comparable 
            storms are referred to simply as "tropical cyclones" or "severe cyclonic storms".

    <h2>Physical Structure</h2>
    <img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Hurricane-en.svg/290px-Hurricane-en.svg.png>
        <p>Tropical cyclones are areas of relatively low pressure in the troposphere, with the 
            largest pressure perturbations occurring at low altitudes near the surface. On Earth, 
            the pressures recorded at the centers of tropical cyclones are among the lowest ever 
            observed at sea level. The environment near the center of tropical cyclones is warmer 
            than the surroundings at all altitudes, thus they are characterized as "warm core" 
            systems.                 
            </p>

        <ul>
            <h3>Wind Field</h3>
            <p>The near-surface wind field of a tropical cyclone is characterized by air rotating rapidly 
                around a center of circulation while also flowing radially inwards. At the outer edge of 
                the storm, air may be nearly calm; however, due to the Earth's rotation, the air has 
                non-zero absolute angular momentum. As air flows radially inward, it begins to rotate 
                cyclonically (counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere, and clockwise in the Southern
                Hemisphere) in order to conserve angular momentum. At an inner radius, air begins to ascend 
                to the top of the troposphere. This radius is typically coincident with the inner radius of 
                the eyewall, and has the strongest near-surface winds of the storm; consequently, it is known 
                as the radius of maximum winds. Once aloft, air flows away from the storm's center, 
                producing a shield of cirrus clouds.
            </p>

            <h3>Eye and Center</h3>
            <p>At the center of a mature tropical cyclone, air sinks rather than rises. For a sufficiently 
                strong storm, air may sink over a layer deep enough to suppress cloud formation, thereby 
                creating a clear "eye". Weather in the eye is normally calm and free of clouds, although 
                the sea may be extremely violent. The eye is normally circular in shape, and is typically 
                19-40 mi in diameter, though eyes as small as 1.9 mi and as large as 230 mi have been 
                observed.

    <h2>Physics and Energetics</h2>
        <img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Hurricane_profile.svg/250px-Hurricane_profile.svg.png>
        <p>The three-dimensional wind field in a tropical cyclone can be separated into two components: 
            a "primary circulation" and a "secondary circulation". The primary circulation is the 
            rotational part of the flow; it is purely circular. The secondary circulation is the 
            overturning (in-up-out-down) part of the flow; it is in the radial and vertical directions. 
            The primary circulation is larger in magnitude, dominating the surface wind field, and is 
            responsible for the majority of the damage a storm causes, while the secondary circulation is 
            slower but governs the energetics of the storm.
